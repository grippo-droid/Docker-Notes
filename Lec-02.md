## Introduction to FastAPI and Its Core Libraries
The video begins with a recap on why learning FastAPI is important for data science, AI, and ML engineers.  
FastAPI is a **modern, high-performance Python web framework** built on two core libraries:
- **Starlette** â€“ Handles HTTP requests/responses (ASGI-based).
- **Pydantic** â€“ Validates incoming data, ensuring it matches expected formats.

This combination allows FastAPI to quickly receive client requests, validate data, and return responses efficiently.

## Core Philosophy Behind FastAPI: Why It Was Created
FastAPI was created to solve:
1. **Performance issues** in older frameworks like Flask (slow under heavy load).
2. **Developer productivity problems** due to boilerplate-heavy code.

FastAPIâ€™s design philosophy:
- **Fast to run** â€“ handle concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Fast to code** â€“ write fewer lines of code to build production APIs.

## Comparison of ASGI (FastAPI) vs WSGI (Flask) Protocols and Their Impact on Performance
- **WSGI (Flask):** Synchronous, blocking model â†’ processes one request at a time. Uses Gunicorn + Werkzeug.  
- **ASGI (FastAPI):** Asynchronous model â†’ handles multiple requests concurrently using `async` / `await`. Uses Uvicorn + Starlette.  

**Analogy:**  
Flask is like a waiter taking one order at a time and waiting until it's ready before taking the next.  
FastAPIâ€™s waiter takes multiple orders and manages them simultaneously.

---

## How ASGI Enables FastAPI to Handle Concurrent Requests with Async/Await
- Supports **asynchronous programming** with `async`/`await`.
- Non-blocking execution: while one request waits (e.g., ML model query), other requests are processed.
- Improves scalability and latency under heavy load.

---

## FastAPIâ€™s Second Philosophy: Fast to Code with Automatic Validation and Documentation
1. **Automatic Input Validation:** Pydantic ensures request data matches expected data types.
2. **Auto-Generated Interactive Docs:** Built-in Swagger UI (`/docs`) for testing APIs directly.
3. **Seamless Integrations:** Works with ML libraries, databases (SQLAlchemy), OAuth, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

## Practical FastAPI Setup and Hello World API Example
Steps:
- Create a project folder and open in VS Code.
- Create/activate a virtual environment.
- Install dependencies: `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.
- Write `main.py`:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/about")
def about():
    return {"info": "This is Campus X"}
